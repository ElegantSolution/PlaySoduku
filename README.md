# PlaySoduku

##

 This C program generates a sudoku game:
 displays the solution game board on the console,
 saves the puzzle game board to file "PlaySudoku.txt".
 
 Compile with a command line tool and run!
 ("PlaySudoku.txt" in the same directory where you run the command line, NOT the output C file directory)
